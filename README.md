# hello-world

Hey yall! You can call me Yung! 

Little about me: 

I’m passionate about digital transformation which inspired me to write an e-book called: “Simplified Path to Digital World Era: Understand Technical Basics the Right Way”. This is one of those personal side projects; as I like to document the information which I find online. My aim of this eBook is to encourage people to follow this similar path that I took to understand new technology advancements. 

I’m particularly interested in Cryptography / Data Science / AI topics therefore I am currently learning Python 3 so I could further advance to PyTorch for Deep Learning. 

I also enjoy meditating and listening to different "Alpha Wave" music as it helps me to stay focused!
