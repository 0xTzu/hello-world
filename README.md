# hello-world

Hey yall! You can call me Yung! 

Little about me: 

University student who thrives to learn more about secure communication and AI!

I have recently began researching into cryptography and trying to fully understand the works of API and SSH Keys, however my programming knowledge is still quite minor. Therefore I'm still expanding my knowledge into Java and JavaScript as I'm planning on creating a project based on my current topic of research.

This is just a start and I will soon start publishing useful information about my findings in the coming future.
